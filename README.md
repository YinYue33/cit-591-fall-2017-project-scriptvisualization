This program was created as a final project of CIT 591 Intro to Software Engineering, University of Pennsylvannia.

Authors: Yichao Li, Yue Yin, Siyang You

The project is a moive script visualization application. It scratches the script of any movie by user's choice, analyzes the script and associated data, and finally visualizes the results. The basic work flow is listed as follows:

1. User searches by typing in a movie name or by choosing a movie genre.
2. When user makes an accurate search, if a script for that movie exists, that result will show up. When user makes a partial search, up to three related movies will be displayed.
3. Then user chooses a movie and decides to visualize it. The movie script is cut into chunks and character name, dialogue and narrative are extracted from each chunk. Then the script is analyzed chunk by chunk and a graph with characters as vertex and relationships between two characters as edge. is sent to the Watson Natural language Understanding API, Watson Personality Insights API and Watson Toner Analyzer API. After the program finishes analyzing, it returns with data analysis of emotion, sentiment, personalities and so on.
4. The results are displayed on webpage. The main characters, character's emotional changes, and the relationship between characters will be shown with graphs like circles, lines and bars.
