Get rolling as fast as you can.  Stay low!  We'll use the topography to separate them and then we can take 'em one on one. 
{}
Bandits at 2 o'clock. 
{}
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold. 
{Tentative=0.874805}
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help. 
{Analytical=0.802429}
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know. 
{}
Can you get 'em off us? 
{}
They're trying to hold formation.  We can chew 'em up! 
{Tentative=0.902459}
When we were growing up, I had everything.  You had nothing.  You climbed out of a hole I couldn't even see the bottom of.  I think maybe when I went off to England, I was trying to measure up to you.  Measuring up's over.  Let's just look out for each other.  Okay? 
{Analytical=0.50698, Tentative=0.941648}
Danny... Land of the free... Land of the free... 
{}
Open bomb bay doors. 
{}
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo? 
{Tentative=0.966403}
We've got him going! 
{}
Sorry. 
{}
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes. 
{}
Waitress!  Four beers! 
{}
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say. 
{Analytical=0.874714, Tentative=0.586281}
Danny, get the hell out of here! 
{}
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn? 
{}
You hear my okay? 
{}
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her. 
{Tentative=0.966403}
What's there? 
{}
It's Germans! 
{}
Ain't no time for spectatin'! 
{}
We'll just have to find a substitute, won't we? 
{Analytical=0.762356}
We gotta face some facts here. 
{Analytical=0.955445}
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me. 
{Analytical=0.924432, Tentative=0.779803}
I can't see the clouds! 
{}
I'm gonna turn in.  I hate being on the water.  I think this is the last sleep I'll get for awhile. 
{}
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back. 
{Confident=0.543112}
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight. 
{Analytical=0.857009, Tentative=0.989892}
I don't know if we're over sea or land. Drop flares and try to spot something. 
{Tentative=0.993583}
No.  You're trying to beat me. 
{Tentative=0.75152}
It must of been a convincing letter. 
{Confident=0.751512}
Bombers. 
{}
Nice to meet you, Betty. 
{}
All of 'em. 
{Confident=0.989586}
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first. 
{Confident=0.983213, Analytical=0.978091}
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die. 
{Confident=0.922197}
How's this? 
{}
You are not bailing out into water! 
{}
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow. 
{}
I thought this was a training flight. I'm just trying to give Danny some training. 
{Analytical=0.720783, Tentative=0.99699}
Fuck you. 
{}
Land of the free. 
{}
Where are we going? 
{}
We burned a lot of fuel back there. Flash them and ask about their supply. 
{Tentative=0.944845}
It won't open til the plane fills! 
{}
You too. 
{}
That's me, Sir. 
{}
How come you're not pukin'? 
{}
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots. 
{}
Crank her! 
{}
Well sure, Colonel -- 
{Confident=0.989586}
The Colonel helped me work it out. 
{}
Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up too? 
{Tentative=0.88939}
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it? 
{Tentative=0.58393}
Good shooting, Danny! 
{}
It's all yours. 
{Confident=0.989586}
Yes, Major. 
{}
McCawley. 
{}
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real. 
{Analytical=0.972915, Tentative=0.698156}
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up. 
{Tentative=0.936899}
We've got him hurt, stay on him! 
{}
Danny... 
{}
Will the others get into the air? 
{}
Maybe I've assumed too much.  Has something changed? I'm afraid to ask what.  And I'm afraid not to. Have you fallen in love? 
{Analytical=0.530786, Tentative=0.969598}
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her. 
{Confident=0.952663}
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off. 
{}
Danny!  Let's play some chicken! 
{Tentative=0.968123}
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here. 
{Analytical=0.61954, Tentative=0.852741}
Does Danny know? 
{Analytical=0.955445}
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter. 
{}
I'll bust you open, you...German! 
{}
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute. 
{Analytical=0.788671, Tentative=0.902459}
You're making a phone call?! 
{}
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you. 
{}
Danny, over there!  We're in a canyon, they'll come straight down it, we'll get 'em in a crossfire. 
{}
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up. 
{Tentative=0.786991}
Not unless we know he's over land! 
{Analytical=0.895415}
Let's go. 
{Analytical=0.579367}
Didn't you say test the limits? 
{}
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine. 
{}
Land of the free... 
{}
Danny!  DANNY! 
{}
Here they come. 
{}
Aw, God.  Oh my God. 
{}
They're in strafing formation, we'll blow right through their line. 
{}
Hang on tight!  I'll put her in the smooth water and we'll swim in! 
{Analytical=0.747663}
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage." 
{Analytical=0.549966}
What?... 
{}
You hang on, Danny!  You hang on!  You're gonna make it! 
{}
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours. 
{Analytical=0.762356}
If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em. 
{}
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German. 
{Analytical=0.705784}
I don't know how long I was in the water. A Norwegian freighter picked me up.  They were headed to Spain.  They docked in La Rota, right beside a German ship, and told me to stay hidden below.  I was afraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some clothes, jumped ship, and found a church, where the priest contacted the resistance, and got me on a freighter to New York. 
{}
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice. 
{Confident=0.968241, Analytical=0.946272}
Home of the Brave. 
{}
That's better. 
{}
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me. 
{Analytical=0.793256, Tentative=0.915789}
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her? 
{}
Rafe McCawley, Sir. 
{}
How can we help? 
{}
We've got coast!  Signal him to climb and jump. 
{}
What's our ETA for Tokyo? 
{}
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you. That must surprise you. 
{Confident=0.859164, Analytical=0.864644}
What else can we do? 
{Analytical=0.687768}
Learn English, then! 
{Analytical=0.982476}
They'll go under you because their planes are faster, then they run so you can't catch 'em.  But then they'll come around and take you from behind -- like some Americans will. 
{Tentative=0.963757}
Danny would'a brought this. 
{}
Nothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get him. 
{Tentative=0.987926}
I'm out of ammo! 
{}
Evelyn... 
{}
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not. 
{}
Upset?  Why should I be upset? 
{}
Yes you can. 
{}
I didn't mean it. 
{Analytical=0.920855}
What for, Sir? 
{}
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral? 
{}
Get me into a plane! 
{}
Yeah. 
{}
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour. I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything. 
{Tentative=0.895195}
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes. 
{Confident=0.986725}
I got a half a tank.  You? 
{}
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away. 
{Confident=0.971165}
There's another one! 
{}
Danny, run for the clouds! 
{}
Let him alone! 
{}
N-O!  We stay together!  I'll go in first. 
{}
It's not getting any longer. 
{Tentative=0.968123}
Evelyn. 
{}
A friend of ours wanted to be sure you're alive.  Evelyn.  A nurse. 
{Confident=0.966751}
Is that the good new, Sir, or -- 
{Tentative=0.91961}
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan. 
{Tentative=0.91961}
Wish I knew, Red. 
{Analytical=0.920855}
That hurt?  I didn't think you had any balls. 
{Analytical=0.883404, Tentative=0.983475}
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing. 
{}
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life. 
{Analytical=0.847927, Tentative=0.86637}
We can explain, Colonel. 
{Analytical=0.920855}
I will.  And your baby. You're gonna be a father. 
{}
Maybe we'll be lucky with the weather. 
{Tentative=0.990161}
Thank you, Sir. 
{}
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there? 
{}
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine. 
{Tentative=0.912653}
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn. 
{}
Danny, there's something I gotta tell you... 
{Tentative=0.91961}
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess. 
{Tentative=0.994704}
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
