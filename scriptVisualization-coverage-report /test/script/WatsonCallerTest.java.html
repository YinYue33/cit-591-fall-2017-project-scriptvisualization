	&quot;This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?&quot; + 
	&quot;I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that &quot; +
	&quot;it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her. &quot; + 
	&quot;I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back. &quot; +
	&quot;Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  &quot; +
	&quot;And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real. &quot; + 
	&quot;Maybe I've assumed too much.  Has something changed? I'm afraid to ask what.  And I'm afraid not to. Have you fallen in love? \n&quot;;
